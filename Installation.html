		<h1>Installation</h1>

		<h2>Before installation</h2>

		<p><strong> The Datahub is a web based application and requires that you 
		have a web server and a database server.</strong></p>

		<p>For 'local' or 'online' Linux based servers, the software that is 
		needed to run the Datahub is known as an "AMP" stack, although 
		Microsoft based servers are also known as a stack.

		<p><strong>AMP</strong> stack stands for</p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>A</strong>pache (or another webserver)</li>
			<li><strong>M</strong>ongoDB</li>
			<li><strong>P</strong>HP</li>
		</ul>

		<p>An online web host provides these technologies as part of their 
		service, or you can install them for free on your Linux, MAC, or 
		Windows computer.</p>

		<h3>System requirements</h3>

		<p>The Datahub is build with the PHP based web framework Symfony. 
		Records are stored in a separate database managed by the MongoDB 
		database system. What do you exactly need to run the software?</p>

		<h4>Disk space</h4>

		<p>A Datahub installation doesn't take a fixed amount of disk space. 
		The core files of the code typically take around 100 MB on your server. 
		You will need extra space for your database, log files and backups 
		though, assuming those reside on the same file system.</p>

		<h4>Web server</h4>

		<p>Symfony based applications can be served using different web server 
		products. Here's a list of the most widely used options:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Nginx (Recommended)</li>
			<li>Apache</li>
			<li>Microsoft IIS</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>PHP</h4>

		<p>The Datahub requires PHP 7.0 or a higher version.</p>

		<p>You wil also need these extra PHP extensions:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>php-cli, php-intl, php-mbstring and php-mcrypt</li>
			<li>The PECL Mongo (PHP5) or PECL Mongodb (PHP7) extension. <br />
			<em>Note that the mongodb extension must be version 1.2.0 or higher. 
			Notably, the package included in Ubuntu 16.04 (php-mongodb) is only 
			at 1.1.5.</em></li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Composer</h4>

		<p>Symfony based applications are managed using <a href="https://getcomposer.org">Composer</a>. This is a dependency management tool for 
		PHP. You will need it to download third party packages during 
		installation, and to install updates later on.</p>

		<h4>MongoDB</h4>

		<p>The Datahub requires MongoDB 3.2.10 or a higher version.</p>

		<h2>Step 1: Get the code</h2>

		<p>The most straightforward way of getting the code is downloading the 
		latest release as a ZIP or TAR ball from Github.</p>

		<p>Alternatively, you can download the code from Packagist with 
		Composer:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
$ composer require foo/bar
{% endhighlight %}

		<p>Clone the Git repository from Github, if you plan development.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
$ git clone https://github.com/thedatahub/Datahub.git datahub
{% endhighlight %}	

		<h2>Step 2: Create a database</h2>

		<p>You will also need a MongoDB database. Make sure you have a running 
		MongoDB database server. Log in into the <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/getting-started/shell/client/">Mongo Shell</a> as a database 
		administrator and execute these commands:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
> use datahub
> db.createUser(
   {
     user: "datahub",
     pwd: "password",
     roles: [ "readWrite", "dbAdmin" ]
   }
)
{% endhighlight %}

		<h2>Step 3: Install dependencies with Composer</h2>

		<p>The Datahub application depends on a series of third party code 
		libraries that need to be downloaded. Go into the directory where you 
		downloaded the core files, and execute this command:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
$ composer install
{% endhighlight %}	

		<p>This will download all the necessary dependencies and store them in
		a directory called <code>vendor</code>.

		<h2>Step 4: Configure your installation</h2>

		<p>During installation, you will be asked to provide a set of 
		configuration settings. This includes the details of the connection to 
		your MongoDB database.</p>

		<ul>
    		<li>The connection to your MongoDB instance (i.e. mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017)</li>
    		<li>The username of the user (i.e. datahub)</li>
    		<li>The password of the user (i.e. password)</li>
    		<li>The database where your data will persist (i.e. datahub)</li>
    	</ul>

    	<p>Your settings will be stored in a file called 
    	<code>app/config/parameters.yml</code>.</p> 

		<h2>Step 5: Up and running</h2>

		<p>Complete the installation by executing these commands which will 
		setup the application and create an application adminstration user.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
$ app/console app:setup
$ app/console doctrine:mongodb:fixtures:load --append
{% endhighlight %}

		<p>PHP comes with its own web server. This is suitable to just test the 
		application without going through the setup of a fully fledged web 
		server. Execute the next command to start the server:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
$ app/console server:run
{% endhighlight %}

		<p>Visit <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000">http://127.0.0.1:8000</a>. You 
		should be greeted by the dashboard welcome screen of the Datahub.</p>

		<p>Refer to the <a href="https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup/web_server_configuration.html">Symfony setup documentation</a> to 
		complete your installation using a fully featured web server in a 
		production environment.</p>
