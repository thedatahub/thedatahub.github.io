		<h1>Introduction</h1>

		<p>The Datahub is an open source metadata aggregator which enables GLAM 
		institutions (Galleries, Archives, Libraries and Museums) to share 
		records, information and knowledge on the Web using open, standardised 
		formats such as LIDO XML or Dublin Core.</p>

		<p>The application features ingesting and publishing of records on the 
		Web via a REST API and an OAI-PMH endpoint. The Datahub supports OAuth 
		authorization for fine-grained access control.</p>

		<p>The Datahub is a web based application build with well established 
		open source technologies like Symfony and MongoDB.</p>

		<h2>Use case</h2>

		<p>GLAM organisations - Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums - 
		face a challenge. Over the years, they acquired or gathered expertise 
		and knowledge about the collections they curate in digital formats. 
		Often this information is stored in databases such as record management 
		systems or collection registration systems. However, using the metadata 
		for the benefit of GLAM audiences is not trivial.</p>

		<p>The lack of an adaptable, maintainable, secure and cost effective 
		infrastructure is a key aspect. A digital architecture based on direct 
		transfer of metadata between databases and end-user applications like 
		websites and mobile applications, proprietary exchange formats and 
		closed source software tools is a brittle solution.</p>

		<p>The Datahub project aims to provide an open alternative based on 
		open source tools and open standards, allowing the cost effective setup 
		and operational maintenance of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture">service oriented architecture</a> of 
		digital services. Creating a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling">loose separation</a> between metadata sources managed by 
		knowledge workers within GLAM organisations, and a host of end user 
		applications, fosters the flexibility and adaptability of the 
		architecture. Paying sufficient attention to these aspects is required 
		to effectively cater towards the everchanging needs of GLAM audiences.</p>

		<p>The primary purpose of the Datahub is to enable this type of loose 
		separation. The application does this by ingesting records from one or 
		multiple metadata sources, persist storage of records, and 
		(re)publishing of these stored records to other applications via 
		standard protocols and formats. Changes to the technical implementation 
		on the side of the metadata source (i.e. a migration to a different 
		product for collection registration) will not carry an impact towards 
		the  end user or consumer applications who rely on data stored and 
		managed in these sources.</p>

		<p>The Datahub is not a records management system nor a collection registration system. The Datahub does not allow records to be edited or 
		changed. The sole purpose of this application is to make aggregation and 
		publishing of metadata as easy as possible.</p>
