		<h1>Introduction</h1>

		<p>The Datahub is an open source metadata aggregator which enables 
		cultural organisations to share records, information and knowledge on 
		the Web using open, standardised exchange formats such as Dublin 
		Core.</p>

		<h2>Key features</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>A JSON based REST API with HATEOS support</li>
			<li>XML Schema validation of ingested records.</li>
			<li>Supports publishing records via OAI-PMH</li>
			<li>Support for LIDO XML and Dublin Core formats</li>
			<li>OAuth support for fine grained access control</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Use case</h2>

		<p>Cultural organisations curate and store expertise and knowledge 
		about the collections in digital formats and databases such as record management systems or collection registration systems. However, making these metadata accessible and reusable for the benefit of their audiences is a challenge.</p>

		<p>The lack of an adaptable, maintainable, secure and cost effective 
		infrastructure is a key obstacle. A digital architecture based on direct 
		transfer of metadata between databases and end-user applications like 
		websites and mobile applications, proprietary exchange formats and 
		closed source software tools is a brittle solution.</p>

		<p>A durable solution consists of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture">service oriented architecture</a>
		based on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling">loose connection</a> between backoffice systems and databases used to manage 
		and preserve metadata records, and the wide array of end user applications - websites, mobile applications, visualisations, print,... - used to cater to the everchanging needs of cultural audiences.</p>

		<p>The Datahub is an open source, web based application that sits 
		between these backoffice systems and end-user applications and ...</p>

		<ul>
			<li>... ingests records structured using standardised, open formats such as Dublin Core or LIDO XML, from one or multiple datasources.</li>
			<li>... persistently stores the ingested records in an internal 
			database.</li>
			<li>... publishes the stored records on the Web via a RESTful API 
			and an OAI-PMH API.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Technical changes at the level of the datasource (i.e. a migration 
		to a different product for records management) do not affect the audience facing consumer applications that reuse metadata to inform, to educate,  to tell stories, to create new insights, to bring new user experiences.</p>

		<h2>Design principles</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>The Datahub is build <strong>API's first</strong>. The 
			application is not meant to cater directly to the specific needs of 
			end-users through userfriendly interfaces. The output are records 
			which can easily be (re)used in consumer applications.</li>
			<li>The Dathahub is focussed on <strong>durability</strong>. The
			application should be simple to use and simple to maintain.</li>
			<li>The Datahub has a <strong>transitive</strong> purpose, not a transformative	purpose. Individual records are not changed nor can 
			be edited. The ingested records will be published as-is through. 
			Neither does the Datahub generate new repressentations of the 
			ingested records.</li>
			<li>The Datahub is <strong>extensible</strong>. Support for new 
			formats and datamodels beyond those used in the cultural domain 
			is easily added.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Technologies</h2>

		<p>The Datahub is a web based application build with well established 
		open source technologies.</p>
